# Maze-solver
solves/makes mazes (doesnt actually make mazes, cos i been busy or whatever)

### Maze Requirements

mazes should only have 1 pixel wide white paths, and black walls
the emtrance should be on the top, and the exit should be on the bottom
there must be a path from entrance to exit, although i might add a checker for this later...
